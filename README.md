# number-guessing-game
A simple number guessing game built in Python for practice and learning.

# 🚀 My Learning Playground

Hi! I'm Zainul — a **newbie** in programming, just getting started and slowly figuring things out.  
This is my personal coding sandbox where I’ll be exploring different technologies like:

- 🐍 Python
- 📄 Markdown
- ⚙️ TypeScript *(coming soon)*

I'm not trying to show off — I'm just trying to learn. Every project here is a small step forward.

---

## 📁 Current Projects

### 🐍 Python
- `number_guessing_game.py` — A basic number guessing game using loops, conditionals, and the `random` module.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Learn by building small, practical projects
- Stay consistent and curious
- Improve gradually and document my growth

---

## 🛠️ Tech I'm Exploring

- Python for logic and scripting
- Markdown for writing clean docs
- TypeScript (soon) for frontend and typed JavaScript

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm just starting out, and I don’t have it all figured out yet — but I’m learning one file at a time.

## 🧠 Note

If you run the Python project by double-clicking the file, the window may close too fast to read the output. To fix that, I added:

```python
input("Press Enter to exit...")
